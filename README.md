# OnlineClock
An analog and/or digital clock designed to be responsive to all devices.

The focus of this project is to creat an easy to use and responsive online clock. The user will be able to switch between analog and digital and the clock will be designed to respond to varying screen sizes using media queries. I want it to us the modern design without being too flat and I want the controls visible and easy to use without being intrusive. It's going to be an experiment with design and code.

This project is strictly a leraning process so at this time I am not looking for help or modifications. I will be testing out techniques and doing things the long way to get the experience and to try out different methods.

You are welcome to follow my progress and giggle at my mistakes :)

Thank you and let's get coding...
